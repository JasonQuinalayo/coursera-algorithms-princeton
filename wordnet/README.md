# WordNet
WordNet is a semantic lexicon for the English language that computational linguists and cognitive scientists use extensively. WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets. For example, { AND circuit, AND gate } is a synset that represent a logical gate that fires only when all of its inputs fire. WordNet also describes semantic relationships between synsets. One such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general synset). For example, the synset { gate, logic gate } is a hypernym of { AND circuit, AND gate } because an AND gate is a kind of logic gate.

```
public class WordNet {

   // constructor takes the name of the two input files
   public WordNet(String synsets, String hypernyms)

   // returns all WordNet nouns
   public Iterable<String> nouns()

   // is the word a WordNet noun?
   public boolean isNoun(String word)

   // distance between nounA and nounB (defined below)
   public int distance(String nounA, String nounB)

   // a synset (second field of synsets.txt) that is the common ancestor of nounA and nounB
   // in a shortest ancestral path (defined below)
   public String sap(String nounA, String nounB)

   // unit testing of this class
   public static void main(String[] args)
}
